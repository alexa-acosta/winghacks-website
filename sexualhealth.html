                    Consent can be withdrawn at any time, as long as it is clearly communicated.
                    Consent cannot be coerced or compelled by force, threat, deception or intimidation.
                    Consent cannot be given by someone who is incapacitated, as defined below.
                    Consent cannot be assumed based on silence, the absence of “no” or “stop,” the existence of a prior or current relationship, or prior sexual activity.</h3>
